This __will__ be useful. Promise. 

In the meantime, here's some useful Markdown syntax:


Emphasis:

*Emphasize* _emphasize_
**Strong** __Strong__


Inline Links:

A [link](http://example.com "Title").


Referenced Links:

Some text with [a link][1] and
another [link][2].

[1]: http://example.com/ "Title"
[2]: http://example.org/ "Title"


Bullet Lists:

* Item
* Item
- Item
- Item


Numbered Lists:

1. Item
2. Item


Mixed Lists:

1. Item
2. Item
   * Mixed
   * Mixed  
3. Item


Blockquotes:

> Quoted text.
> > Quoted quote.

> * Quoted 
> * List


Preformatted:

  Begin each line with 
  two spaces or more to 
  make text look
  e x a c t l y 
  like  you  type i
  t.


Code:

`This is code`


Code block:

~~~
This is a piece
of code
in a code block
~~~

```
So is this
```


Syntax Highlighting:

```css
#button {
	border: none;
}
```


Headers:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3 
#### Header 4 ####
##### Header 5 #####
###### Header 6 ######


Tables:

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3


That's all for now. Ripped from [here][3] and [here][4]

# Git Repo Downloader #

I'm not sure how well this thing works yet. Just ripped it, is currently 
untessted. Will update when it gets tested with my feelings.

## Note ##

This isn't proper git. It just rips repos. If you pull twice, It will 
__overwrite__ old files. This will make you sad. 

Pulled from [pastebin][1], so feasibly you don't even need this repo entry
to download this thing. But hey, git.
